## The Pizza Cycle

The Pizza Cycle is a data art piece exploring a descent into booze, madness and visualisation all through the medium of pizza.

It is entertainment damnit. And yes, it is about a picture I took in a London park years ago that I couldn't get out of my head. I mean, come on, it's insane though isn't it? Who would just chuck a pizza all over the place? Pizza is amazing. It's one of the few things we have left to hang on to in this world. And someone just went and did that. So I naturally thought after some time that the obvious thing to do would be a visualisation and data design piss-take on the whole thing.

### Things used so far

- [Billboard.js](https://naver.github.io/billboard.js/)

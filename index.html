        <p>It all started simply enough, walking through a park in East London and coming across what looked to be an entire circular-shaped pizza strewn, thrown really, madly about an approximately ten square meter space.</p>

        <h2>Plausible Scenario #1</h2>
        <p>Steve was likely his name. He was likely christened Stephen in his hometown of Derby in the English Midlands. He was likely 32 and surly lately. He had lived in London up until that point for six years which is the point at which the dross of the fetid city begins to eat at your bones. There are few healthy responses to this. Steve chose the likeliest and most common response, despair, dread and inhuman amounts of lager.</p>
        <p>One fine summer day it came to a head.</p>

It was cause to celebrate, yet he was consumed with regret and self-hatred. The data indicates that Steve was as this guy at the bar said, "off his tits."</sub>

        <p>Steve hated onions. It was that simple. It really is. However, the first scenario doesn't really address first principles potentialaties. Steve opened the box with haste. it was lunch time. Well, an early lunch time at any rate. He was hungry. Things were simple. Simple as the sun hanging there in the sky smiling down on what was otherwise to be a halfway decent day. It wasn't to be.</p>
